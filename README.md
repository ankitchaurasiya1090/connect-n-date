## Project Purpose
This project is a Next.js application integrated with Firebase services. It serves as a starter template demonstrating how to build a web application with authentication, data storage, and potentially other Firebase features.
## Features
- **User Authentication:** Allows users to sign up, sign in, and potentially sign out using Firebase Authentication.
- **Data Storage:** Utilizes Firebase Firestore for storing and managing application data.
- **AI Integration:** Includes components and logic for interacting with AI models, potentially for features like generating icebreakers or providing suggestions.
- **User Profiles:** Provides pages for viewing and editing user profiles.
- **Chat Functionality:** Includes components for a chat interface, suggesting potential real-time communication features using Firebase.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with a component library (likely Shadcn UI based on the file structure) that facilitates creating responsive user interfaces.
## Technologies Used
- **Next.js:** A React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase:** A platform for building web and mobile applications, used here for Authentication and Firestore.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Shadcn UI:** A collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Genkit:** A framework for building AI-powered applications (indicated by the `src/ai` directory).
